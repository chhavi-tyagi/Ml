 Multiple linear regression
 Model selection using Mulitple Linear Regression using Dataset from UCI ML Repository The dataset is Concrete Compressive Strength. It has 8 predictor variables and 1 response variable named as strength. My aim is to build the best model using model selection techniques and using only Multiple linear regression.
 
 The Project involved chosing the best model using multiple linear regression on a dataset from UCI ML repository named as Concrete Compressive Strength.
It has 8 predictor variables and one response variable named as strength.
My aim here is to find the right amount of mixtures to be added so as to have the best strength of concrete.
8 variables are the ingredients that are to be added to get best concrete strength.
I have used various model selection techniques including AIC and BIC as well as R squared values.
My best model has 31 features with R squared value of 0.8789 with no overfitting in the model.
